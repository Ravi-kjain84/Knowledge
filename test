Subject: Testing CoE Strategy – Next Steps

Hi Monica / Stacy,

Thank you for your support and willingness to be involved in the Testing CoE strategy.

I agree that this phase is mostly about getting alignment across teams on the strategy objectives and proposals. Most of our proposals focus on Shift-Left principles and ensuring testing is completed within sprints as part of an Agile way of working. To make this transition smooth, we will need a mindset shift and Agile training for the teams.

I expect we will be able to finalize the strategy proposals by March 21st, so I’d like to set up a separate call with you in the third week of March to discuss how we can further align the strategy with Agile ways of working and take your guidance on the mindset shift. We can also talk about what Agile trainings would be useful for the testing teams and how to maintain governance over the strategy moving forward.

Please feel free to skip the Friday advisory meetings for now. I will set up some time for you and Stacy around March 20th and add a placeholder for that. Let me know if that works for you.

I really appreciate your support, and Ushaan is also happy to have you as part of our advisory group. I will keep you copied on the meeting minutes, so you can stay updated on the direction the strategy is taking.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
[Your Name]
