I wanted to share that I will be transitioning to a new role as Testing CoE Lead, effective 16 March.

Thank you for your support and confidence in my skills over the years. My experiences here will make me more resilient and help me move forward.

I look forward to your guidance in the future. I have scheduled some time on 28 February when you will be in Gurgaon, and I look forward to catching up then.

Thanks again for all your support.
