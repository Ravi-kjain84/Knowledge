Subject: Support Required for Testing Strategy Implementation

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I’d like to request your support on two key phases of our Testing Strategy implementation:

Phase 1: Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Governance
	•	I propose setting up a Working Group with all Testing Leads in the FCD team to review Testing Strategy Guidelines and explore integration with Design teams to optimize resource utilization.
	•	Representation from Design Leads will also be essential for improving collaboration between design and testing functions.
	•	I’ll coordinate with them to define a RACI on OKRs and set timelines, which we can monitor through weekly WG calls.

I can compile the list of Test and Design leads—your support will help ensure this initiative is considered as part of our strategic goals.

Phase 2: Agile Implementation
	•	We can initiate a Working Group with Sub-Value Stream Leads to discuss team alignment within SVS PODs and integrate Testing teams accordingly.
	•	A fortnightly check-in can help us track progress effectively.

Please let me know your thoughts and if you’re aligned with moving forward on this.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
