### **Challenge: Gaps in End-to-End Traceability**  
Test cases and evidence may not always be logged in JIRA, creating gaps in the traceability matrix and tracking across testing phases. Many UAT test scenarios and evidence performed by end users are not consistently captured in JIRA, leading to incomplete traceability. Additionally, FT, UAT, and development teams may not be referring to the same project in JIRA to perform their activities, causing misalignment, traceability issues, and duplicate effort to maintain issues across multiple JIRA projects.  

**Solution:**  
All testing activities – from unit tests and functional tests to UAT – should be linked to specific requirements and documented in JIRA through a comprehensive traceability matrix. Clear guidelines and accountability for logging UAT scenarios and evidence in JIRA should be established to ensure consistent documentation. A unified project structure in JIRA should be implemented to align FT, UAT, and development teams under the same environment, reducing duplication and improving traceability. Consolidating test management under a single, standardized project structure will minimize administrative effort and improve consistency. A governance process should be established to monitor and maintain traceability completeness across all testing phases.
