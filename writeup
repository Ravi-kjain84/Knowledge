Here’s a refined version incorporating the mention of DataGuard and the additional recipient responsible for it:

Subject: Introduction & Alignment on Q2 2025 RWA & DataGuard

Dear [Recipient’s Name] & [DataGuard POC’s Name],

I recently joined as the FCD - Testing CoE Lead and am part of the TCoE advisory group, working to define a structured testing strategy for efficiency and best practices.

As part of this initiative, we have selected the Q2 2025 RWA release as a pilot run to shape and refine our approach. To support this, we are collaborating with FT, UAT, design, and build teams. Graham suggested I connect with [Recipient’s Name] to align on sprint plans and key points of contact.

Additionally, I’d like to understand the usage of DataGuard and its integration with our testing framework. [DataGuard POC’s Name], I will set up a meeting to discuss this further.

Let me know a convenient time to connect.

Best,
Ravi
