Challenge: Strengthening Testing Team Capabilities
Testing teams have varying levels of expertise in tools, techniques, domain knowledge, and agile methodologies, which may impact overall testing effectiveness. Aligning skills across teams can help improve consistency and enhance the quality of testing outcomes. A standardized onboarding package will also help new joiners quickly adapt to testing processes, tools, and business context.

Solution:
The training framework should cover:
	•	Agile Testing – Consistent application of agile testing practices.
	•	Technical Skills – Training on tools like Python and data visualization.
	•	Domain Knowledge – Value stream-specific training to improve business understanding.
	•	Stakeholder Management – Enhancing communication and collaboration with business and technical teams.

This approach will strengthen testing capabilities, improve efficiency, and drive consistent results.
