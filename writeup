8.8. Peer Review and Accountability

All test cases and test evidence should undergo a formal peer review process to improve accuracy and completeness. Test cases should be reviewed and logged in JIRA by a separate reviewer to identify any gaps or misalignments. The Test Lead is accountable for ensuring the review is completed, either by personally reviewing or delegating it to a qualified team member. Test evidence in JIRA should also be reviewed to confirm alignment with expected outcomes and business requirements.

Benefits:
	•	Improves accuracy and consistency of test cases and evidence.
	•	Enhances defect detection and resolution by addressing gaps early.
	•	Strengthens accountability and governance over the testing process.

⸻

8.9. Test Case Reusability and Automation

Testing teams should identify and mark test cases as reusable or non-reusable during retrospectives. Reusable test cases should be prioritized for automation to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort. A structured repository of reusable test cases should be maintained in JIRA to simplify future test creation and execution.

Benefits:
	•	Reduces redundancy and effort in test creation.
	•	Improves efficiency through automated execution of reusable tests.
	•	Enhances consistency and coverage across similar test scenarios.

8.10. Creating Test Releases in JIRA

A structured test release should be created in JIRA for every project, change release, or maintenance release. Test cases, execution results, and defects should be linked to the release for better tracking and visibility. This will provide a clear view of test progress, defect resolution, and release readiness.

Benefits:
	•	Improves tracking and monitoring of test execution and defects.
	•	Enhances traceability by linking test cases and outcomes to specific releases.
	•	Provides better visibility into release readiness and decision-making.

Challenge 10: Enhancing Testing to Cover Downstream Impacts of Implemented Changes
When a new change is implemented, most testing activities are typically confined to the technical, functional, and current Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenarios. However, late-stage production defects often arise because downstream systems were not tested against the upcoming change. This gap increases the risk of system instability and operational disruptions.

Solution:
Introduce a comprehensive downstream impact analysis as part of the testing process. Ensure that test cases cover not only the direct functional and technical impacts but also the downstream system dependencies. Develop cross-system test cases and incorporate them into the regression suite to validate the end-to-end impact of changes.

Benefits:
This approach will improve system stability and operational resilience by ensuring that downstream dependencies are tested alongside direct functional changes. It will enable early detection of downstream issues, reducing production failures and improving the overall quality of releases. Stronger alignment between system components and business processes will lead to smoother post-implementation performance and better user satisfaction.

Challenge 10: Missed Opportunity to Test Existing Production Controls and Validations
Currently, testing teams are not covering existing Business-As-Usual (BAU) controls and validation rules performed during daily, monthly, or quarterly reporting cycles. This results in gaps and increased risk of production issues.

Solution:
Incorporate existing end-user validations and controls into regression testing to ensure comprehensive coverage of BAU processes. Use automated checks to validate data and system behavior against predefined rules.

Benefits:
This approach will reduce the risk of production defects by ensuring that BAU processes are thoroughly validated and tested. It will improve confidence in test results by establishing consistent and accurate validation against business requirements. Enhanced alignment with business processes will lead to smoother operational performance and reduced risk of disruptions during reporting cycles.

Testing KPIs for Effectiveness and Efficiency

To measure the success and maturity of the Testing Center of Excellence (TCoE), it is essential to define a clear set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that reflect both the effectiveness and efficiency of the testing process. These KPIs will provide quantitative insights into the performance of testing activities, highlight gaps, and support continuous improvement. The proposed KPIs are structured around two key value dimensions: Effectiveness and Efficiency.

Effectiveness KPIs

Effectiveness KPIs measure the ability of the testing process to identify defects early, ensure traceability, and minimize leakage into production. These KPIs are designed to improve the overall quality of testing outcomes and reduce production issues.
	1.	Pre-UAT Defect Containment
This KPI measures the percentage of defects identified and resolved during unit or functional testing before they reach UAT or production. The objective is to detect and fix defects at the earliest stage of the development lifecycle to avoid costly fixes in production and reduce the risk of operational disruption. The target for this KPI is set at 100%, which reflects the goal of achieving complete defect containment within the early testing phases. High containment indicates a mature and effective testing process, reducing the likelihood of issues surfacing in UAT or production.
	2.	Traceability
Traceability measures the percentage of defects linked to specific requirements and test cases in JIRA. Ensuring 100% traceability enhances transparency and control over the testing process, enabling teams to track the origin of defects, understand testing coverage, and improve accountability. Strong traceability ensures that all requirements are effectively validated, reducing the risk of missed requirements or unexpected functionality gaps. The target for this KPI is set at 100%, reinforcing the need for comprehensive and structured test coverage.

⸻

Efficiency KPIs

Efficiency KPIs focus on optimizing the speed, coverage, and availability of test cases to enhance the overall testing process. These KPIs aim to reduce cycle time, improve automation levels, and ensure that test cases are prepared and available when needed.
	1.	Automation Coverage
This KPI measures the percentage of regression and functional test cases automated in JIRA. Higher automation coverage improves testing speed, reduces manual effort, and enhances test repeatability. The target for this KPI is 70%, striking a balance between automation efficiency and the need for manual testing where required. Achieving high automation coverage increases the ability to run tests frequently and detect issues earlier.
	2.	Test Cycle Time
Test cycle time measures the average time taken from “Ready for Testing” to “Testing Complete” in JIRA. Reducing test cycle time reflects improvements in testing efficiency and faster feedback loops. The target is to reduce the test cycle time by 50% compared to the baseline, ensuring faster releases and improved responsiveness to changes.
	3.	Test Case Availability
This KPI measures the percentage of test cases created and uploaded to JIRA before the release baseline is completed. High test case availability ensures that the testing team is prepared in advance, reducing delays and improving overall test execution readiness. The target for this KPI is set at 100%, reflecting the need for complete test case readiness before the release cycle begins.

Rationale and Expected Outcomes

By focusing on both effectiveness and efficiency, these KPIs aim to create a balanced testing framework that ensures high-quality outcomes while optimizing time and resources. Effective defect containment and traceability will minimize production issues and improve overall testing accuracy. Meanwhile, improving automation coverage, reducing cycle time, and ensuring test case availability will drive faster execution and increase the capacity to handle more complex testing scenarios. Collectively, these KPIs will provide a clear view of testing maturity, support continuous improvement, and strengthen alignment with business goals.
